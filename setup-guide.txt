WISP Router Monitoring Setup Guide
==================================

Step 1: Set up the central server
---------------------------------
1. Choose a server/VPS to host your monitoring API
2. Install Node.js and npm
3. Copy the server files to your server:
   - server.js
   - package.json
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
5. Modify server.js with your preferred API key
6. Start the server with `npm start`

Step 2: Prepare the RouterOS script
----------------------------------
1. Edit mikrotik-full-report.rsc and update:
   - serverURL: Change to your server's URL
   - apiKey: Change to match your server's expected API key
2. Test the script on one router first

Step 3: Deploy to MikroTik routers
----------------------------------
Method A - Via WinBox:
1. Open WinBox and connect to a router
2. Go to System > Scripts
3. Click "+" to add a new script
4. Name it "wisp-monitoring"
5. Paste the contents of mikrotik-full-report.rsc
6. Click "Apply" and "OK"

Method B - Via Terminal:
1. Connect to router via SSH
2. Use the following command to import script:
   ```
   /import file=wisp-monitoring.rsc
   ```

Step 4: Verify the setup
------------------------
1. Check the server logs to see if data is being received
2. Look at the router logs for any errors:
   ```
   /log print
   ```
3. Manually run the script to test:
   ```
   /system script run wisp-monitoring
   ```

Security Recommendations
------------------------
1. Use HTTPS for the API endpoint
2. Implement strong API keys
3. Consider IP whitelisting on your server
4. Regularly rotate API keys
5. Monitor for unusual data patterns

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If the script fails, check the router logs
- Ensure the server URL is accessible from the router
- Verify the API key is correct
- Check firewall settings on both ends
- Test with a simple HTTP endpoint first if needed
